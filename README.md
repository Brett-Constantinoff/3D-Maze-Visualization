# 3D Maze Generator / Solver

This project visualizes two popular graph / tree traversal algorthims, depth first search(dfs) and breadth first search(bfs) and applies them to the problem of solving a maze.

Once the maze is generated, either one of the two algorithms can be used to solve the maze and it all done in real time allowing one to visualize how the algorithms work.
